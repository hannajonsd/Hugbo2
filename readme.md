### Assignment 1

As of 11/2/2024:

Currently on schedule with regards to the project plan.

- A project skeleton has been created for the android app, including all classes shown in the UML class diagram. No features have been implemented in the app as of yet.

- The java spring backend has been adapted: rest controllers have been added and appropriate functions have been created such that it can serve as an api for the android app.
